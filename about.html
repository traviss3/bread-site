			<h1>About 4218 Sourdough</h1>
			<div class="maintext">
				<p>4218 Sourdough was born out of downtime and total amazement with all things bread.
				I had the idea for this business back in 2021 shortly after my wife moved in with me. I love just being in the kitchen.
				There is nothing better than that yeasty smell soaking your house after a loaf, bagel, or bun comes hot out of the oven.
				So this my little way of trying to bring a piece of that to everyone</p>
